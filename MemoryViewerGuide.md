## Hello! In this guide, we'll be going over the basic steps to using Memory Viewer properly within Dark Souls 3. 


The first step to using Memory Viewer will be to open "Find Bullet / Effect / Goods / Attack Address" and you can do this by clicking the box next to it. This will activate the script, allowing you to use it.

> This is what you will be using to find Bullet addresses, Effect Addresses, etc. and this, is what it should look like;

Now before you do anything regarding Memory Viewer, tick the box that says "Switch to VEH debugger." Otherwise Dark Souls 3 or Cheat Engine may crash. 

Once you have that box ticked, go to whatever you'd like to find (Bullet, Effect, Goods, or Attack) and tick the box next to it. This will lock in what you'd like to find.

> What you have now should look like this;

And congratulations, you're now ready to use Memory Viewer. To do so, click the button that says "Memory View" above the table. This is a base part of Cheat Engine, and _incredibly_ useful.

This will open up a window that _may_ look confusing at first, but is rather simple for what we're doing. 

Simply press Ctrl+G to bring up another window where you'll type in what you'd like to find. If you're looking for an effect, you'd type in "Effect", if you're looking for a bullet, you'd type in "Bullet", and so on and so forth.

Once you've done that, it will have taken you to an area within Memory Viewer that deals with what you're looking for. In our case, we're looking for a bullet.

> You'll now need to right-click on "Bullet" and select "Find out what addresses this instruction accesses"

This will bring up another window. This is what you will be using to find the address of the bullet/effect/good/etc.

In our case, simply fire a bullet, like Warmth. This will give you an address;

Now, right click on the address and select "Copy Address to clipboard" This will, obviously, copy the address so you can paste it into a helper, but Helpers, for now, are another thing.

And congratulations, you have successfully used Memory Viewer within Dark Souls 3. 
----
As a closing statement, please remember _addresses are not static. They are dynamic._ Meaning they will be different with each game restart, so you'll need to find them again for any other edits you wish to make.
